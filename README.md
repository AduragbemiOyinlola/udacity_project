# **ALX-T DATA ANALYST NANODEGREE PROGRAM**

This repository contains all my projects for the ALX-T Data Analyst Nanodegree Program. I got this program as a scholarship and it is sponsored by [ALX](https://www.alxafrica.com/) and the program took place on [Udacity website](https://www.udacity.com/courses/all). 

The program teaches the data analysis process and practice investigating different datasets using Python and its powerful packages for data analysis.

## **PROJECT 1**

For the first project, I worked on a medical dataset having 110527 rows and 14 columns. The aim of the project is to clean and to predict if patients will show up for their appointment or not.

## **PROJECT 2**

The second project deals with creating interesting and trustworthy analysis and visualizations. The project has the needed data across three(3) files with different file format.

## **PROJECT 3**

Working on the third project, I used the Ford GoBike system data; this data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. The dataset contain 183412 rows and  16 columns.

I will be using this dataset to predict if the individual used to bike to complete the trip or not. This project contains mainly visualization as this is the tool that was used to gain insight from the data.

## **PROJECT 4**
