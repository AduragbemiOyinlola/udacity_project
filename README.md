# **ALX-T DATA ANALYST NANODEGREE PROGRAM**

This repository contains all my projects for the ALX-T Data Analyst Nanodegree Program. I got this program as a scholarship and it is sponsored by [ALX](https://www.alxafrica.com/) and the program took place on [Udacity website](https://www.udacity.com/courses/all). 

The program teaches the data analysis process and practice investigating different datasets using Python and its powerful packages for data analysis. The projects were of two types; the practical projects and the digital profiles projects.

# **HANDS ON PRACTICAL PROJECT**

## **PROJECT 1**

For the first project, I worked on a medical dataset having 110527 rows and 14 columns. The aim of the project is to clean and to predict if patients will show up for their appointment or not.

## **PROJECT 2**

The second project deals with creating interesting and trustworthy analysis and visualizations. The project has the needed data across three(3) files with different file format.

## **PROJECT 3**

Working on the third project, I used the Ford GoBike system data; this data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. The dataset contain 183412 rows and  16 columns.

I will be using this dataset to predict if the individual used to bike to complete the trip or not. This project contains mainly visualization as this is the tool that was used to gain insight from the data.

# **DIGITAL PROFILE**

## **PROJECT 4**

The first digital profile that was worked on is the **GitHub**  profile they were lectures on how to build your GitHub profile like a pro. First I learnt the basic of using **Git** which is for version control and then GitHub which is an hosting platform. Learnt how to create a repository, add and commit files, push and pull changes, check the status of a _repo_ etc.

## **PROJECT 5**

The LinkedIn profile was the next digital profile to build, in this section of the program I was taught how to build my LinkedIn profile like a pro and how to attract recruiters with my LinkedIn profile. Connecting with people, interacting with posts, posting my projects, are part of what was learnt in this section of the program.

## **PROJECT 6**

Writing a professional cover letter was the next digital profile that was worked on. In this section, I learnt the components of cover letter which includes heading, introduction, 2-3 body paragraphs and conclusion. The purpose of cover letter was also discussed.

## **PROJECT 7**

Crafting a resume was the next project, this section deals with creating a professional resume knowing what should be added to a resume and what not to be added to a resume(extraneous information).
